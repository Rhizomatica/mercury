# Mercury

Mercury is a free software software-defined modem solution for the High-Frequency (HF) band.

## Features

- Least Square channel estimator with a configurable estimation window.
- Time and Frequency synchronization for low SNR values.
- TX and RX filtering with separate filters for time synchronization and data messages.
- Time and Frequency interleavers.
- LDPC codes (1/16 to 14/16) optimized for multipath channel
- Outer CRC coding.
- Energy dispersal for power amplification efficiency.
- Pre-equalization to compensate filters and DSP imperfections.
- Peak to average power ratio (PAPR) and modulation error rate (MER) measurements.
- Two pilot distribution modes for different channels and bitrate requirements with further optimized parameters such as number of symbols, number of carriers, and synchronization symbols.
- Dynamic partial configuration of the physical layer for computing performance enhancement.
- Enhanced API of the physical layer to allow for byte or bit transfer.
- Separate Data and Acknowledge message robustness configuration.
- Ladder-based Gearshift mode for the data link layer for low SNR.
- 17 robustness modes for the ARQ/ Gearshift.


## Compilation And Installation

Mercury is implemented mainly in C++. Currently tested on Linux and Windows (Windows port still beta quality).
Compilation is tested with GCC (version 9 or greater) under Linux and Windows. ALSA and PulseAudio libraries and development headers must be installed on Linux. 
Other optional depencies are GNUPlot (for ploting constellations), GraphViz and Doxygen (for documentation). On
a Debian based system (eg. Debian, Ubuntu), the dependencies can be installed with:

```
apt-get install libasound2-dev libpulse-dev gnuplot-x11 graphviz
```
To compile, use:

```
make
```

To install:

```
make install
```

To generate the Mercury documentation, run the following:

```
make doc
```

Mercury main platform is Linux. Windows port is beta quality and some bugs might exist.

## Running

Mercury have some basic operating modes and test modes.

```
./mercury -m [mode] -i [device] -o [device] -r [radio_type] -x [sound_system]
./mercury -m ARQ -i [device] -o [device] -r [radio_type] -x [sound_system]
./mercury -h

Options:
 -c [cpu_nr]                Run on CPU [cpu_br]. Defaults to CPU 3. Use -1 to disable CPU selection
 -m [mode]                  Available operating modes are: ARQ, TX_SHM, RX_SHM, TX_TEST, RX_TEST, TX_RAND, RX_RAND, PLOT_BASEBAND, PLOT_PASSBAND
 -s [modulation_config]     Sets modulation configuration for non-ARQ setups (0 to 16). Use "-l" for listing all available modulations
 -r [radio_type]            Available radio types are: stockhf, sbitx
 -i [device]                Radio Capture device id (eg: "plughw:0,0")
 -o [device]                Radio Playback device id (eg: "plughw:0,0")
 -x [sound_system]          Sets the sound system API to use: alsa, pulse, dsound or wasapi
 -l                         Lists all modulator/coding modes
 -z                         Lists all available sound cards
 -h                         Prints this help.

```

Mercury operating modes are:
- ARQ: Data-link layer and Automatic repeat request mode (under development).
- TX_SHM: Transmits data read from shared memory interface (check folder examples).
- RX_SHM: Received data is written to shared memory interface.

Mercury also has some modes for development / channel analysis:
- PLOT_BASEBAND: Baseband Bit Error Rate (BER) simulation mode over an AWGN channel with/without plotting.
- PLOT_PASSBAND: Passeband BER simulation mode over an AWGN channel with/without plotting.
- TX_RAND: Transmission test using random data as source
- RX_RAND: Data reception test (supports plotting constelation)
- TX_TEST: Data transmission test (a moving byte set to 1, all the rest zeros)
- RX_TEST: Data reception test

For using the shared memory interface, Mercury should be started in mode RX_SHM in receive side, and TX_SHM at transmit site. 

Example (stock hf radio, like an ICOM IC-7100) for transmitter side:
```
./mercury -m TX_SHM -s 1 -r stockhf -i "plughw:0,0" -o "plughw:0,0"
```

Example of Mercury in the receive side (sBitx v3 radio):
```
./mercury -m RX_SHM -s 1 -r sbitx -i "plughw:0,0" -o "plughw:0,0"
```

ARQ mode is under active development and can be used, for example, in a stock HF radio, as:

```
./mercury -m ARQ -r stockhf -i "plughw:0,0" -o "plughw:0,0"
```

For receiving broadcat data in test mode, for example, in a sBitx radio, using mode 0, use:

```
./mercury -m RX_TEST -s 0 -r sbitx -i "plughw:0,0" -o "plughw:0,0"
```

For transmitting such test data broadcast data, in stock HF radio (like an ICOM IC-7100), using mode 0, use (and key the radio using rigctl):

```
./mercury -m TX_TEST -s 0 -r stockhf -i "plughw:0,0" -o "plughw:0,0"
```

For enabling tx (keying the radio) in an ICOM IC-7100, for example, use:

```
rigctl -r /dev/ttyUSB0 -m 3070 T 1
```

For unkeying:

```
rigctl -r /dev/ttyUSB0 -m 3070 T 0
```

For the sBitx radio, use the HERMES software stack, available at https://github.com/Rhizomatica/hermes-net (use trx_v2-userland implementation).

## Supported clients

Mercury alone is not very useful. A client is needed to receive and transmit information using Mercury. The folder "examples" has a transmitter and receiver example
to use with the TX_SHM and RX_SHM modes. A more complete client called HERMES-BROADCAST to be used for data broadcast which uses RaptorQ codes is available here: https://github.com/Rhizomatica/hermes-broadcast .

For a simple ARQ client which supports hamlib, take a look at: https://github.com/Rhizomatica/mercury-connector

For a more complete ARQ client which integrates Mercury to UUCP, look at: https://github.com/Rhizomatica/hermes-net/tree/main/uucpd
